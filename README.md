# Get Started
1. Clone this repository locally
2. Open the project in [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/)
3. Tweak stuff
# How it works
This is a sandbox I developed to figure out and learn about physics in Godot.  
Shells are Rigidbodies with disctinct properties and you can affect them to see the results.  

- You can drag'n'drop (or even "drag'n'throw" shells with the click of your mouse)
- You can set the values of `force` (default: `1000`) and `impulse` (default: `500`) with the sliders and adjust how fast time pasts
- Pressing the Spacebar or clicking its representation in the UI will apply a impulse in a random direction to every shell according to the method `shell.apply_central_impulse(Vector2(randi_range(-impulse, impulse), randi_range(-impulse, impulse)))`  
IMPORTANT : some specific shells react to the spacebar in other ways IN ADDITION of this impulse (details below)
- Pressing or clicking the Arrow Keys will apply a constant force to every shell in the direction pressed (continuous press is advised for better results) according to the method `shell.apply_force(direction * force)`
- Clicking the reset button or pressing the Enter key will reset every shell to its original position
- The dropdown menu allows you to add certain "Effect Areas" to the scene, impacting the behaviour of Shells inside their area  
# RigidBodies
Each Shell is an instance of a `Shell` scene that includes a RigidBody2D with distinct properties.  
As stated before, in addition to reacting to a random impulse when the spacebar is pressed, some shells also have other properties which will be detailed here:  
## Existing Shells
NOTE : For the shells which name begins with "Switch", the spacebar action inverts the forces applied to them  
| Name | Properties
| --- | --- 
| Normal : | Godot 4 default RigidBody2D and base for all the others. Only modifications are: <br/> It has Freeze Mode set to `Kinematic`, Contact Monitor set to `true`, max contacts `5`, Continuous CD set to `Cast Shape` (change this if you encounter performance issues), and is `pickable`.
| Not Pickable : | 'Pickable' set to `false` from the editor
| Freeze Static : | Freeze set to `true`, Freeze mode set to `Static` from the editor
| Freeze Kinematic : | Freeze set to `true`, Freeze mode set to `Kinematic` from the editor
| Very Heavy : | Mass set to `50` kg from the editor
| Very Light : | Mass set to `0.25` kg from the editor
| Force Up : | Constant Forces/Force set to `(0, -force)` from the editor <br/> Reacts to changes to `force` made with the slider (resets and apply new `force`)
| Force Up Left : | Constant Forces/Force set to `(-force/2, -force)` from the editor <br /> Reacts to changes to `force` made with the slider (resets and apply new `force`)
| Force Antigrav : | Constant Forces/Force set to `(0, -980)` from the editor
| Switch Central Force : | Constant Forces/Force set to `(force, 0)` from the editor <br /> When the SpaceBar is pressed, apply a force according to `shell.add_constant_central_force(- shell.constant_force * 2)` <br /> Reacts to changes to `force` made with the slider (resets and apply new `force`)
| Switch Force Offset : | Constant Force applied at `_ready()` with the method `shell.add_constant_force(Vector2(-force, 0), Vector2(0, 6))` <br /> When the SpaceBar is pressed, resets the shell `constant_force` and `constant_torque` then apply a force according to `shell.add_constant_force(- previous_shell_constant_force, Vector2(0, 6))` <br /> Reacts to changes to `force` made with the slider (resets and apply new `force`)
| Switch Torque : | Constant Forces/Torque set to `force` from the editor <br /> When the SpaceBar is pressed, apply a torque according to `shell.add_constant_torque(- shell.constant_torque * 2)` <br /> Reacts to changes to `force` made with the slider (resets and apply new `force`)
| No Gravity : | Gravity Scale set to `0` from the editor
| Torque : | Constant Forces/Torque set to `-force` from the editor <br /> Reacts to changes to `force` made with the slider (resets and apply new `force`)
| Torque No Grav : | Constant Forces/Torque set to `-force` and Gravity Scale set to `0` from the editor <br /> Reacts to changes to `force` made with the slider (resets and apply new `force`)
| Offset Impulse : | Like "Normal", when SpaceBar is pressed, apply an impulse according to `shell.apply_impulse(Vector2(0, 6), Vector2(randi_range(-impulse, impulse), -impulse * 2))`
| Torque Impulse : | Like "Normal", when SpaceBar is pressed, apply an impulse according to `shell.apply_torque_impulse(impulse * 20)`
| Frictionless : | Physics Material/Friction set to `0` from the editor
| Rough : | Physics Material/Rough set to `true` from the editor
| Frictionless Rough : | Physics Material/Friction set to `0` and Physics Material/Rough set to `true` from the editor
| Bouncy : | Physics Material/Bounce set to `1` from the editor
| Absorb Bounce : | Physics Material/Bounce set to `1` and Absorbent set to `true` from the editor
| Bouncy No Grav : | Like "Bouncy" but Gravity Scale set to `0` from the editor
| Bouncy Frictionless : | Physics Material/Friction set to `0` and Physics Material/Bounce set to `1` from the editor
| Bouncy No Damping : | Like "Bouncy" but Linear/Damp Mode set to `replace` and Damp set to `0`
| Rotation Locked : | Rotated 90Â° and Lock Rotation set to `true` from the editor
